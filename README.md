# MinION-analysis-scripts
This script was developed by me (Bernardo Almeida) and aims to help in MinION sequences analysis. It serves 2 purposes: join many fastq.gz files in a single fastq.gz file to enable an easier analysis on programs like GenomeDetective; enable an alternative user-friendly way of analysing BAM files for dubious positions in the consensus sequence
